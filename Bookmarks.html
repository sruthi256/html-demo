    <p>Web designing refers to the process of creating a website. 
        It involves designing and building the layout, structure, and 
        overall aesthetic of a website. A good web designer should have 
        knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
         as well as an understanding of design principles, user experience (UX), 
         and user interface (UI). The goal of web designing is to create a 
         visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively 
         communicates a message or sells a product. It's an important field that
          requires creativity, technical skills, and attention to detail.

    <h3 id="html">HTML5</h3>
    <p>
        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. 
        It is the fifth major version of the HTML standard and was first released in 2014.
        HTML5 is a significant revision to the HTML standard, introducing new semanticmeaning 
        to structural elements, improved media handling, and enhanced form controls. 
        Key features include canvas and audio/video elements, web storage, and improved 
        offline support. HTML5 also provides a more flexible and extensible language, allowing
         developers to create rich and dynamic web applications. Its improved support for 
         multimedia content enables the creation of sophisticated web-based applications, 
         including games and interactive media. With its growing support across browsers, 
         HTML5 is now a standard for building modern web applications.

<h3 id="javascript">Java Script</h3>

<p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language created by 
    Brendan Eich in 1995. It's primarily used for client-side scripting on the web, allowing 
    developers to add interactive elements to websites and web applications. JavaScript is 
    also popular for developing desktop and mobile applications, as well as server-side 
    programming with technologies like Node.js. Its syntax is similar to Java, with a focus 
    on prototype-based object-oriented programming. JavaScript is widely supported by web 
    browsers and is an essential skill for web development.</p>
